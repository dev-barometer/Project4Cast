# How to Connect GitHub in Vercel

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Click "Authentication" in the Left Sidebar

On the Account Settings page, look at the **left sidebar** (under "General"). You should see:
- Authentication ← **Click this one!**
- Sign in with Vercel
- Billing Information
- etc.

### Step 2: Find GitHub Connection

Once you click "Authentication", you should see options for connecting external accounts like:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- etc.

### Step 3: Connect GitHub

1. Find **GitHub** in the list
2. Click **"Connect"** or **"Connect GitHub"**
3. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
5. Return to Vercel

## Alternative: Check Project Settings

If you still don't see it in Authentication, try:

1. Go back to your **project** (project4-cast)
2. Click **Settings** (in the project, not account settings)
3. Look for **"Git"** or **"Git Repository"** section
4. You might be able to connect GitHub there

## What You're Looking For

After connecting, you should see:
- ✅ GitHub (Connected)
- Your GitHub username/organization name

This will fix the "BarclayM is not a team member" error!
