## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

2. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
3. Log in

**Tell me when you're there!** 👋

## 🎯 The Big Picture

You're going to create a **second Vercel project** that:
- Uses the **same code** (from GitHub)
- But deploys from the **`staging` branch** (not `main`)
- Has a **different name**: `project4cast-staging`
- Shows a **yellow banner** so you know it's staging

This way:
- **Production** = `main` branch = No banner = Be careful!
- **Staging** = `staging` branch = Yellow banner = Safe to test!
