# Add BarclayM to Vercel

## Option 1: Connect BarclayM GitHub Account (If Supported)

Some Vercel accounts allow connecting multiple GitHub accounts:

1. Go to **Account Settings** → **Authentication**
2. Look for GitHub in the list
3. If you see an option to "Add another GitHub account" or "Connect additional account", click it
4. Authorize with your "BarclayM" GitHub account
5. Both accounts should then be connected

**Note:** Vercel may only allow one GitHub account per Vercel account. If so, use Option 2.

## Option 2: Add BarclayM as a Team Member (Recommended)

Since you're on the Hobby plan, you might need to upgrade to add team members. But let's try the free option first:

### Step 1: Check Your Team Settings

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your team name ("barclay's projects") in the top left
3. Go to **Settings** → **Team** (or **Members**)
4. Look for an "Invite" or "Add Member" button

### Step 2: Invite BarclayM

1. Click **"Invite Member"** or **"Add Member"**
2. Enter the email associated with your "BarclayM" GitHub account
3. OR if it asks for a GitHub username, enter "BarclayM"
4. Send the invitation

### Step 3: Accept Invitation

1. Check the email for the invitation
2. Accept it
3. Make sure to connect your "BarclayM" GitHub account when prompted

## Option 3: Upgrade to Pro (If Free Option Doesn't Work)

If the Hobby plan doesn't allow adding members:

1. The email you received mentioned "Upgrade to Pro"
2. Pro plan allows adding collaborators
3. This costs $20/month per user

## Quick Check: Can You Add Members on Hobby Plan?

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click your team name → **Settings** → **Team** or **Members**
3. If you see an "Invite" button, you can add members for free!
4. If you don't see it, you may need to upgrade

## Alternative: Make Repository Public (Free, No Upgrade)

If adding members doesn't work or you don't want to upgrade:

1. Go to https://github.com/dev-barometer/Project4Cast
2. **Settings** → **General** → Scroll to **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click **"Change visibility"** → **"Make public"**

This allows any GitHub account (including "BarclayM") to trigger deployments without needing to be added as a team member.

## Recommendation

1. **First, try Option 2** (add as team member) - it's free if your plan supports it
2. **If that doesn't work**, make the repo public (also free)
3. **Only upgrade to Pro** if you need private repos AND multiple collaborators
