# Creating App Icons

To create the app icons, you can:

1. Use an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Create 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images with your logo
3. Save them as:
   - public/icon-192.png
   - public/icon-512.png

For now, the app will work without icons, but they'll show as a default icon.
